## About the projects

This application allows you to apply filters on the video stream of the webcam
The filters used are high pass and low pass filters

high-pass filters:
* Sobel (3x3)
* Sobel (5*5)
* Prewitt
* Laplace
* Log
* Canny
* FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Gradient
* FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) Gradient 2
* Threshold


low-pass filters:
* Gauss(3*3)
* Gauss(5*5)
* Blur(3x3)
* Blur(5x5)
* Blur(7x7)
